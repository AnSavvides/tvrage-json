# TV Rage JSON

A node.js API for the [TVRage web services](http://services.tvrage.com/info.php?page=main); as per the name, all responses are JSON.

# Installation

var TVRage = require("tvragejson");

// Search for a show by name, returning the first match.
TVRage.search("The Big Bang Theory", function(err, response) {
    if (!err) {
        console.log(response["Results"]["show"][0]);
    }
});

// Get information for a particular show - in this case we
// are using the show ID for "The Big Bang Theory".
TVRage.search("8511", function(err, response) {
    if (!err) {
        console.log(response);
    }

# Contributing
All contributions are welcome, feel free to fork `master`, make your changes and open a pull request.

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is used with the [JSHint](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint) and [Watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch) plugins.
To get up and running with grunt you need to do the following:

* Install the [Grunt Command Line Interface tools](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli):
`npm install -g grunt-cli`
* Install the current Grunt version local to this project (so ensure you make this within the project's directory):
`npm install grunt --save-dev`

Upon making any code changes, make sure you run `grunt test` from within the project's directory to verify that there are no errors (this is done using the JSHint plugin mentioned above) - if there are any errors, make all necessary changes before opening a pull request.
